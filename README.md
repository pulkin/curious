curious -- parallel function sampling
=====================================

Samples multidimensional scalar functions by observing curvature features.
Uses arbitrary executables as a target function.
Based on `scipy` triangulation `scipy.spatial.Delaunay`.

Inspired by [python-adaptive](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive).
